# Unimorph_Inflect: A Python NLP Library for Generating Morphological Inflection in Many Human Languages

## Setup

Unimorph_inflect supports Python 3.6 or later. We strongly recommend that you install Unimorph_inflect from PyPI. If you already have [pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), simply run
```bash
pip install unimorph_inflect
```
this should also help resolve all of the dependencies of unimorph_inflect, for instance [DyNet](https://dynet.readthedocs.io/) 2.0.0 or above.

Alternatively, you can also install from source of this git repository, which will give you more flexibility in developing on top of unimorph_inflect and training your own models. For this option, run
```bash
git clone git@github.com:antonisa/unimorph_inflect.git
cd unimorph_inflect
python setup.py install
#pip install -e .
```

### Getting Started

You can get started by simply following these steps in your Python interactive interpreter:

```python
>>> import unimorph_inflect
>>> unimorph_inflect.download('eng')   # This downloads the English models, if you don't have them already
>>>
>>> from unimorph_inflect import inflect
>>> result = inflect("laugh", "V;PST", language='eng')
>>> print(result[0])
laughed
```
Note: `inflect()` returns a list of outputs, hence the "[0]") there

You don't really need to explicitly download each dataset (as shown in the second line above); the `inflect()` function will ask you about downloading the model for a language if it is not downloaded already.

### Trained Models for unimorph_inflect

We currently provide models trained on all Unimorph data (except 1000 examples used as a development set) for some high-resource languages, trained in a monolingual setting. 

You can list the available languages/models with:
```
>>> unimorph_inflect.supported_languages
['ady', 'ang', 'ast', 'bel', 'bul', 'cat', 'dan', ...]
```

The accuracy on the development sets are as follows:

A simple call of the `inflect` function with your desired language should download the necessary models, but you can also download them from [here](https://github.com/antonisa/unimorph_inflect/blob/master/models).

This release is not the same as CMU's SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared Task system. The system is a cleaned up version of the shared task code and the models are trained on almost all Unimorph data for each language, whereas in the competition we used the designated datasets.
